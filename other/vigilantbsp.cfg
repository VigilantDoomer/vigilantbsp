// Below are configurations for this nodebuilder. If you want to make your own configurations,
// it is recommended to do so in your own file as this file will be updated each release.

// NOTE: Nodebuilder configuration key names defined here must be unique for all nodebuilders!
// Recommend to start the key name with the name of the compiler, followed by underscore and a specific name.

// The "compiler" setting must refer to an existing compiler (such as defined above), but it
// does not have to be a compiler defined in the same configuration file.

// 2025-01-13 VigilantDoomer: I added -rm option to those that don't have produce zero reject,
// so as RMB file (same name as map but extension .rej rather than .wad) can be loaded if
// exists. BUT! It requires editor cooperation, because editor places input file with only
// requisite map in temporary file. In order for RMB options to work, the editor will need
// to implement functionality to copy any .rej file to said temp folder whose name matches
// that of wad, and rename such .rej file to the same basename as a temporary wad file passed
// as an input. I don't think editor currently does this -- you will have to ask developer
// to add such support.
