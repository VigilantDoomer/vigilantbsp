Changelog for VigilantBSP

v0.72a
- Fixed bug: some sectors wrongly considered compatible with each other and sector 0 in "advanced visplane reduction" algorithm 
- Fixed bug: unlike what is written in documentation, specifying positive diagonal penalty didn't force enable it to all levels, now it does
- Forced 64-bit math on 32-bit computers in critical areas of seg splitting code
- Secondary score option changed to priority: split minimization or depth reduction. Some maps benefit from the former, other maps - from the latter.
- Sped-up 32-bit Windows executable by making bsp tree builder codebase use fixed-point math for superblocks. This shouldn't introduce any errors 
- Fixed bug that prevented VigilantBSP from recognising Doom 1 and Heretic levels (ExMy)
- New option to build only specific levels rather than all levels

v0.69a
- Reformatted changelog
- Added option named: "Use secondary score for partition selection"
- Fixed bug: dummy linedefs created by nodebuilder to implement fast/remote scrolling shall not be added to blockmap and bsp tree
- Introduced debug parameters intended for programmers and people who otherwise know programming and can analyze source code
- Fixed bug: panic in blockmap builder due to linedef with max index was missing from bounds computation
- Fixed bug: panic in reject builder due to out-of-bounds access to array of solid (1-sided) lines in certain circumstances

v0.67a 
- Initial alpha build
