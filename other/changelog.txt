- Fixed bug: some sectors wrongly considered compatible with each other and sector 0 in "advanced visplane reduction" algorithm 
- Changed what is considered to contribute to subsector creation when secondary metric is computed
- Fixed bug: unlike what is written in documentation, specifying positive diagonal penalty didn't force enable it to all levels, now it does
- Forced 64-bit math on 32-bit computers in critical areas of seg splitting code
