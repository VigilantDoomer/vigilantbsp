Changelog for VigilantBSP

v0.82a
- New feature: added new partition algorithm - "Zennode/Zokumbsp-like (tree balance and depth)"  
    See also "Debug and other hidden parameters", "--zenvar" on how to set numeric parameters used in formula
    Not affected by -nf=<number> (factor parameter)
    Affected by "secondary priority selection"
- New feature: added "balanced tree" variant to "Priority for partition selection" option
    When advanced visplane reduction is combined with this option, numeric parameters from "--zenvar" also have effect
    (in addition to factor from -nf=<number>)
- Added hidden option documented under "Debug and other hidden parameters", "--sidecache"

v0.78a
- Fixed bug: Zdoom extended/compressed nodebuilding now uses the correct precision, map02 of watrsp.wad now builds correctly
- Fixed bug: detailed levels that had problems now shall be built correctly with vanilla and DeeP nodes as well (same map as an example as previous)
    This leads to a change in the way some maps are built, and might result in increased segs and visplanes (but VigilantBSP tries
    to avoid using that on vanilla maps). See "Debug and other hidden parameters", --detailnodes if you are interested in
    more information/control over this.
- Nodebuilder no longer adds vertices that are duplicate of existing ones (although these occurences were seldom before), this will result in smaller VERTEXES lump 
- Redone bug fix for broken polyobject in Guardian of Steel and the like so that fewer segs and visplanes are generated for maps with polyobjects
- Improved heuristics in advanced visplane reduction partitioner (more accurate measure of partition length without the parts that lie in the void).
- When blockmap builder is allowed to select a dummy linedef different from zero, it will prefer linedefs that are shorter than 2048 units.
- Failure to write report file when requested by REPORT option in RMB options file is no longer regarded as fatal.
- Decreased memory use when building reject
- Nodebuilder is now able to represent in NODES lump partition lines derived from very long linedefs without overflows most of the time

v0.75a
- New feature: option to generate nodes in Zdoom non-GL extended and compressed formats
    Known bug: a section near the end of map02 of watrsp.wad (Water Spirit by Manbou) is built incorrectly IF specific combination of options is used (advanced visplane reduction + output is extended or compressed nodes format). Specifically, invisible stairs are erroneously created towards the end of map02, posing an impassable blockade. I'm currently investigating the issue.
- New feature: an option to remove non-collideable lines from blockmap, disabled by default. Takes care not to destroy self-referencing sector effects, but still needs a lot of testing from users targeting non-Doom games or advanced engines
- Fixed bug: Guardian of Steel, map05 of Hexen, had broken polyobject when rebuilt using default partitioner 
- Sped up multi-tree just a bit 
- The initial order of segs (before splits) will now correspond to order of linedefs even when using "cull invisible linedefs" option
- In vanilla nodes format, when number of segs grows large, segs corresponding to subsector with greatest amount of segs will be moved to the end of seg list to prevent overflow in vanilla/unsigned ports provided this is possible
- Added hidden option to produce unreversed BSP nodes array, which might (or might not) offer performance benefits on old (486?) processors. See "Debug and other hidden parameters", "--unreversenodes".
- Improvement: specifying an endgoal for blockmap in deterministic mode no longer cancels multi-threading
- Minor change: removed "(limited recognition)" notice next to Deep nodes format option as it can be read ambiguously. 

v0.74a
- New feature: partial RMB support!
- New feature: multi-tree! For now, it is simplest form of multi-tree (finding best BSP tree out of several) - where only root node is bruteforced among all possible choices. Credit: jerko for suggesting this.
- Fixed severe bug in reject builder that sometimes prevented monsters from sighting the player
- Stricter ordering of log output - output pertaining to the previous map is displayed strictly before one pertaining to next map
- (Relevant to programmers) Can now build VigilantBSP on Go 1.15+ (was 1.17+). This is so you can build it on current Debian stable (bullseye) using Debian repository's version of Go
- (Relevant to programmers) Refactored code for my future plans to implement Zdoom non-GL extended / compressed nodes generation support
- Documentation: rewrited note about linedef specials that affect angle with more up-to-date knowledge on ports support and interaction with wall wiggle fix. Still could be improved, though.

v0.72a
- Fixed bug: some sectors wrongly considered compatible with each other and sector 0 in "advanced visplane reduction" algorithm 
- Fixed bug: unlike what is written in documentation, specifying positive diagonal penalty didn't force enable it to all levels, now it does
- Forced 64-bit math on 32-bit computers in critical areas of seg splitting code
- Secondary score option changed to priority: split minimization or depth reduction. Some maps benefit from the former, other maps - from the latter.
- Sped-up 32-bit Windows executable by making bsp tree builder codebase use fixed-point math for superblocks. This shouldn't introduce any errors 
- Fixed bug that prevented VigilantBSP from recognising Doom 1 and Heretic levels (ExMy)
- New option to build only specific levels rather than all levels

v0.69a
- Reformatted changelog
- Added option named: "Use secondary score for partition selection"
- Fixed bug: dummy linedefs created by nodebuilder to implement fast/remote scrolling shall not be added to blockmap and bsp tree
- Introduced debug parameters intended for programmers and people who otherwise know programming and can analyze source code
- Fixed bug: panic in blockmap builder due to linedef with max index was missing from bounds computation
- Fixed bug: panic in reject builder due to out-of-bounds access to array of solid (1-sided) lines in certain circumstances

v0.67a 
- Initial alpha build
