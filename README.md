## Description

VigilantBSP is a multi-threaded polyobject-aware
node / blockmap / reject builder (also called "nodebuilder" for 
brevity) for Doom / Doom 2 / Heretic / Hexen. 

It is being developed for Windows and GNU/Linux operating system on
both x86 (32-bit) and x86-64 (64-bit) platforms.

## Project goals

VigilantBSP intends to fulfill several ambitious goals:

1. Fast build times for maps without sacrificing support for 
special effects like self-referencing sectors. Use parallelism
where possible to achieve faster builds on multi-core computers.
2. Support for Heretic and Hexen games being as robust as support
for Doom / Doom 2.
3. Features that help get maps within vanilla limits are researched
and implemented, without getting in the way of support for maps 
targeting advanced engines (Boom, etc.)
4. Make self-referencing sector effects easy to use for mappers.
Default settings should already support self-referencing sector
effects very well. Monsters in self-referencing sectors shall
be able to see, hear and attack the player.
5. Special effects provided by other nodebuilders (horizon effect
and "precious" linedefs from BSP v5.2, faster scrollers from 
ZokumBSP) are also implemented.

In future, support for GL nodes / UDMF format MAY be considered
as well.

Partial support for RMB effects is already implemented since
version 0.74a. Eventually, most RMB effects are going to be
supported.

Since 0.75a, VigilantBSP can output non-GL nodes in Zdoom 
extended and compressed nodes format besides vanilla and
DeeP format. 

## Debt of gratitude

VigilantBSP is indebted to other free/libre software nodebuilders
for their ideas and implementations, and intends to give back its
own ideas as well. This is achieved by using a free software license.

The list of nodebuilders and people whose work make it all possible
includes, but is not limited to:

BSP v5.2 by Colin Reed, Lee Killough and other contributors to BSP (program),

Zennode by Marc Rousseau,

## Building from source

Documentation yet to be done, but it is actually simple. You
install Go programming environment, git clone this repository,
and issueing "go build" should just work. If you modify source
code, you'll need to use "go generate" followed by "go build",
as some parts of code are generated from others. Such autogenerated
*.go files are distinguished by a special comment:
"// Code generated from other source files. DO NOT EDIT."
as the very top line.

VigilantBSP v0.85a is the last version to build with Go 1.15.
All versions that'll succeed it will require Go 1.19 at the minimum,
which is the current version of Go for Debian Bookworm and
the last Go version to support Windows 7. I do not intend
to drop Windows 7 support, so this Go version will remain
supported for a long time.

It can be built with later versions of Go, you don't have to
downgrade.

## Website / contact information

Currently the only way to contact me is on github. You can file
feature requests and bug reports via "Issues" tab of this repository.

I was away from development in later half of 2023 and for the entire 2024 basically,
but will resume development of VigilantBSP in year 2025. Hence I'll probably setup
accounts on Doomworld and Zdoom forums, but I'm not exactly rushing until I've
something new to show. I don't plan to engage with other Doom communities,
definitely not with those which have abysmal communication standards.

If I make Doom accounts, I will update this README. If you encountered someone
pretending to me but their account is not listed here, they're likely not me.
